DESCRIPTION:A new series of stories in the oral tradition from Frank Delane
 y...\n\nTonight: The Sea-Folk\nThe names of those seaboard counties throb w
 ith atmosphere - Donegal\, Sligo\, Mayo\, Galway\, Clare\, Kerry\, and down
  and around to Cork and Waterford. Who knows what creatures came ashore fro
 m there in days so dark that their shadows had shadows? Or observed humans 
 from out in the tide? And who knows how they interacted with the people on 
 the land? The seanchai knew\; that was his profession - to know the unknowa
 ble and tell it to the rest of us sitting around the fire. In some farmhous
 e\, deep in the middle of a fertile county\, where they never hear the surf
 \, and never even glimpse a wandering sea-gull\, they can only imagine the 
 rampaging white horses of the waves as they gallop toward the shore\, and t
 he sad high notes of the mermaid's fatal song.\n\n\nTonight's 7pm session w
 ill be preceded by a special "Seanchai Prologue" at 6:45pm...\nImaginative 
 minds give themselves permission to read mythology as history. Legends aris
 e out of practical need\; a raider has to be repulsed\; a dragon slain\; a 
 kingly alliance formed\, perhaps through marriage\, for mutual territorial 
 interest.\nBut it goes deeper...

  we see in our minds.Our own images. And only ours. The fireside storytelle

 y...\n\nTonight: The Druid\nLet me straighten out something at the beginnin
 g. Our ancient times knew very few people as important as druids. They were
  learned men who could tell you the story of the world\, and they committed
  everything to memory\, because if it was written down somebody could steal
  it. They were wise men whose advice was sought by kings and commoners\, be
 cause it was usually sound advice. They were mostly true men\, who had the 
 good of their people at heart\, but of course now and then you'd find a few
  rogues\, a few unscrupulous tricksters. Like the man I'm going to tell you
  about...\n\nTonight's 7pm session will be preceded by a special "Seanchai 
 Prologue" at 6:45pm...\nThe wandering storyteller\, the seanchai.. a univer
 sal archetype\, all our ancestors encountered the Seanchai\, or someone of 
 the like\, in every part of the world. Imagine\, that you're sitting by the
  fire in an Irish farmhouse kitchen any time in the last few hundred years\
 , and an old man with a  long parchment face comes in\, shakes the weather 
 from the shoulders of his long black coat\, sits down\, accepts a glass of 
 whiskey\, lights his pipe and begins...
