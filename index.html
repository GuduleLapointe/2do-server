    <h1>2do directory</h1>

    <p><strong>2do.directory</strong> is a public, hypergrid search engine for OpenSimulator.
      It provides results for in-world search places, land for sale, classifieds and events.
      Data are collected from several OpenSimulator grids.</p>

    <p><center>
      <a href="events/"><button>View calendar online</button></a>
    </center></p>

    <p>This page gives grid owners instructions to enable <a href="#search">in-world search</a> and <a href="#events">events</a> on their own grid.</p>

    <h2 id="search">Enable in-world search in your grid</h2>

    <p>To enable in-world search in your grid without installing the web application:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Download <a href="https://github.com/GuduleLapointe/flexible_helper_scripts/tree/master/bin">OpenSimSearch.Module.dll</a> and put it inside your OpenSim bin/ folder.</p></li>
      <li><p>For each simulator, add the following settings in <b>OpenSim.ini</b> file
        (<em>even for grids, this config goes in regions OpenSim.ini, not in Robust.ini</em>). Don't forget to replace <code>Your Grid</code> and <code>yourgrid.org:8002</code> with your own values).</p>

        <pre>
[Search]
  ;; Set this section to enable in-world search
  SearchURL = "http://2do.directory/helpers/query.php?gk=http://yourgrid.org:8002"
  ;; the gk parameter is needed to avoid hypergrid issues and must be set to your grid Gatekeeper URL

[DataSnapshot]
  ;; Set this section to include your grid places, land for sale and classifieds in search results
  index_sims = true
  gridname = "Your Grid"
  snapshot_cache_directory = "./DataSnapshot"
  DATA_SRV_2do = http://2do.directory/helpers/register.php

  ;; You can register to multiple search engines:
  ;DATA_SRV_MISearch = http://metaverseink.com/cgi-bin/register.py
  ;DATA_SRV_OtherEngine = http://example.org/helpers/register.py
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li><p>Restart all simulators.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="events">Include your grid events in 2do.directory</h2>

    <p>Please send a mail to <a href=mailto:dev@2do.pm>dev@2do.pm</a>, including the <strong>public URL of your calendar</strong> and your grid <strong>default landing area</strong>
      <em>(which will be used when the destination an event is not set or not properly formatted)</em>.</p>

    <p>The easiest format is iCal standard (.ics), so any calendar service allowing an ics URL shoud do the trick (including Google Agenda).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Times must be set correctly according to your calendar time zone</strong>. 2do engine will take care of the conversion to grid time (PST/PDT).
        <br><em>Example: If your events is at noon grid-time (00:00 PM PST/PDT) but your own calendar is on Europe/Paris time zone, set your event the local time in Paris (20:00 or 21:00 depending on daylight saving).</em>
        </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Think about daylight saving time</strong>, particularly for recurring events. Daylight Saving Time follow differrent rules depending on countries, even the date of the switch varies. So a given time in your local area will not always correspond to the same grid time (unless you live in Los Angeles of course). E.g.:
        <ul>
          <li>If you your recurring events happens at noon, grid-time, whatever day of the year, you should set your own calendar timezone to PST/PDT (and your local time might vary).</li>
          <li>If you want your local time to remain unchanged, set your calendar to your local time zone (and the grid-time might vary).</li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>Location</strong> should be set to the teleport URL of the destination, e.g. <code>yougrid.org:8002:Welcome Area</code></li>
      <li>
        <strong>Category</strong> can be set different ways:
        <ul>
          <li>If your calendar handles categories, use this feature.</li>
          <li>
            Otherwisse, you can insert a tag in the description, in the form: <code>[[Category:Music]]</code>
          </li>
          <li>If none of the above apply, 2do engine will try to guess from the event title and description.
        </ul>
        <p>
          Current categories are inherited from original HYPEvents project
          <br><em>Art, Education, Fair, Lecture, Literature, Music, Roleplay, Social</em>
        </p><p>
          Work is in progress to convert them to official viewer categories
          <em>(Discussion, Sports, Live DJ, Live Music, Commercial, Nightlife/Entertainment, Games/Contests, Pageants, Education, Arts and Culture, Charity/Support Groups)</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other formats are possible, but they would require an analysis and the development of a specific parser.</p>
