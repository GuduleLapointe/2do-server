<h1>Potentially Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Since none of the questions below have been actually asked, this page is a Potentially Asked Questions and not a Frequently Asked Questions.</p>
<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p>This site is an overview of events taking place in the hypergrid (also known as the metaverse).</p>
<h2>How do you get the information for the listed events?</h2>
We pull it from the event calendars that are published on the listed grids websites. When a grid publishes an ical feed, it is easy. But many grids have web-based event calendars. We parse those (caching sub-pages to limit load on the grid's webservers) and convert them to ical.
<h2>What grids are listed?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metropolis</li>
<li>Great canadian grid</li>
<li>Littlefield grid</li>
<li>Third Rock Grid</li>
<li>and more..</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why isn't grid XYZ not on the calendar?</h2>
<p>Probably because we don't know about it! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:frost@linkwater.org">frost@linkwater.org</a> and let us know about the grid's event calendar!</p>
